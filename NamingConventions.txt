                 String Builder:-

Class:-
The StringBuilder in Java represents a mutable sequence of characters. Since the String Class in Java creates an immutable sequence of characters, the StringBuilder class provides an alternative to String Class, as it creates a mutable sequence of characters.

java.lang.Object
↳ java.lang
↳ Class StringBuilder

Syntax:
public final class StringBuilder
extends Object
implements Serializable, CharSequence

Function:-
The function of StringBuilder is very much similar to the StringBuffer class, as both of them provide an alternative to String Class by making a mutable sequence of characters. However the StringBuilder class differs from the StringBuffer class on the basis of synchronization.
The StringBuilder class provides no guarantee of synchronization whereas the StringBuffer class does. Therefore this class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer in places where the StringBuffer was being used by a single thread (as is generally the case). Where possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to StringBuffer as it will be faster under most implementations. Instances of StringBuilder are not safe for use by multiple threads.
If such synchronization is required then it is recommended that StringBuffer be used.

                                  Naming Conevntion:-

StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();

                     LocalDateTime

The LocalDateTime is a new class introduced in Java 8 new Date and Time API. This class is in java.time package and it represents both date and time information without timezone.
  Java LocalDateTime class declaration :
  public final class LocalDateTime extends Object  implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>, Serializable

  Functions :-
 LocalDateTime.now() creates a LocalDateTime object with current  date and time
 LocalDateTime.of() method is a factory method to create  LocalDateTime with specific date and time
   atDate() and atTime() method of LocalDate and LocalTime class.

  Naming Conventions:-

   LocalDateTime rightNow = LocalDateTime.now();
